## Guidelines

- any changes related to colour or positioning or any aesthetic change make sure that you diagnose it and make all the changes in all the places related to theme. So that any change should reflect the whole team so if I change other colour of the theme, all the places inside that theme should have same changes respective to that colour theme.
