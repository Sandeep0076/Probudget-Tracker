## Guidelines

- any changes related to colour or positioning or any aesthetic change make sure that you diagnose it and make all the changes in all the places related to theme. So that any change should reflect the whole team so if I change other colour of the theme, all the places inside that theme should have same changes respective to that colour theme.
- whenever you need to debug or find why the thing is not working always add Loggings statements so that I can see on the Terminal what's happening. 
- I have deployed the website on https://probudget-frontend.onrender.com/. Both front end and back and is deployed there
